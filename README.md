## Description
  The Smart Glass project is a tool primarily intended to aid the hearing impaired in daily activities. The tool will have a series of functions, such as alerting of alarms or phone calls, providing a favorable environment for these people to have a normal life.
  The project is aimed at the large field of assistive technology, which aims to include people in society through projects that meet the special needs of many people.
  The smart-glass design is ideal for connecting to a smartphone app or an automated home, alerting the hearing impaired to what's going on around them.
